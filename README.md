# backend_showdown_2024_q1
This repo aims to explain my implementation of a backend for the 2024 Q1 Backend Showdown. This is my first experience writing a backend, especially one that must adhere to the CPU and memory constraints imposed by the competition. I'll separate my api's development into modules so that I can cover the steps that I took. Initially, I'll explain my logic and some concepts to develop the core of the api, to understand the Rust libraries involved in backend development. Then, how to deploy the code and include the use of a load balancer. Finally, some optimizations to improve performance.
