# backend_showdown_2024_q1
This repo aims at explaining my implementation of a backend for the 2024 Q1 Backend Showdown. This is my first experience at writing a backend, especially one that must adhere to the CPU and memory constraints imposed by the competition. I'll start with the details of my initial version, where I attempt to simply make it work, and then go through some optimizations to improve performance.

LEMBRETES:
* Olhar os includes dos outros participantes
* Usar otimizacoes para a versao release (cargo build --release)
* Atentar-se quando nao ha necessidade de retornar corpo de respostas
* Deixar as imagens do Docker publicas, e nao so locais
